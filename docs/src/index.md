**Metatheory.jl** is a general purpose term rewriting, metaprogramming and
algebraic computation library for the Julia programming language, designed to
take advantage of the powerful reflection capabilities to bridge the gap between
symbolic mathematics, abstract interpretation, equational reasoning,
optimization, composable compiler transforms, and advanced homoiconic pattern
matching features. The core features of Metatheory.jl are a powerful rewrite
rule definition language, a vast library of functional combinators for classical
term rewriting and an *[e-graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-graph)
rewriting*, a fresh approach to term rewriting achieved through an equality
saturation algorithm. Metatheory.jl can manipulate any kind of Julia symbolic
expression type, as long as it satisfies [TermInterface.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSymbolics/TermInterface.jl).

Metatheory.jl provides:
- An eDSL (embedded domain specific language) to define different kinds of symbolic rewrite rules.
- A classical rewriting backend, derived from the [SymbolicUtils.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSymbolics/SymbolicUtils.jl) pattern matcher, supporting associative-commutative rules. It is based on the pattern matcher in the [SICM book](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/titles/content/sicm_edition_2/book.html).
- A flexible library of rewriter combinators.
- An [e-graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-graph) rewriting (equality saturation) engine, based on the [egg](https://egraphs-good.github.io/) library, supporting a backtracking  pattern matcher and non-deterministic term rewriting by using a data structure called [e-graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-graph), efficiently incorporating the notion of equivalence in order to reduce the amount of user effort required to achieve optimization tasks and equational reasoning.
- `@capture` macro for flexible metaprogramming.

Intuitively, Metatheory.jl transforms Julia expressions
in other Julia expressions at both compile and run time. 

This allows users to perform customized and composable compiler optimizations specifically tailored to single, arbitrary Julia packages.

Our library provides a simple, algebraically composable interface to help scientists in implementing and reasoning about semantics and all kinds of formal systems, by defining concise rewriting rules in pure, syntactically valid Julia on a high level of abstraction. Our implementation of equality saturation on e-graphs is based on the excellent, state-of-the-art technique implemented in the [egg](https://egraphs-good.github.io/) library, reimplemented in pure Julia.

## Real World Applications

Most importantly, there are many **practical real world applications** where Metatheory.jl could be used. Let's
work together to turn this list into some new Julia packages:


#### Integration with Symbolics.jl

Many features of this package, such as the classical rewriting system, have been ported from [SymbolicUtils.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSymbolics/SymbolicUtils.jl), and are technically the same. Integration between Metatheory.jl with Symbolics.jl **is currently
in-development**, as we recently released a new version of [TermInterface.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSymbolics/TermInterface.jl). 

An integration between Metatheory.jl and [Symbolics.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSymbolics/Symbolics.jl) is possible and has previously been shown in the ["High-performance symbolic-numerics via multiple dispatch"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.03949) paper. Once we reach consensus for a shared symbolic term interface, Metatheory.jl can be used to:

- Rewrite Symbolics.jl expressions with **bi-directional equations** instead of simple directed rewrite rules.
- Search for the space of mathematically equivalent Symbolics.jl expressions for more computationally efficient forms to speed various packages like  [ModelingToolkit.jl](https://github.com/SciML/ModelingToolkit.jl) that numerically evaluate Symbolics.jl expressions.
- When proof production is introduced in Metatheory.jl, automatically search the space of a domain-specific equational theory to prove that Symbolics.jl expressions are equal in that theory. 
- Other scientific domains extending Symbolics.jl for system modeling.

#### Simplifying Quantum Algebras

[QuantumCumulants.jl](https://github.com/qojulia/QuantumCumulants.jl/) automates
the symbolic derivation of mean-field equations in quantum mechanics, expanding
them in cumulants and generating numerical solutions using state-of-the-art
solvers like [ModelingToolkit.jl](https://github.com/SciML/ModelingToolkit.jl)
and
[DifferentialEquations.jl](https://github.com/SciML/DifferentialEquations.jl). A
potential application for Metatheory.jl is domain-specific code optimization for
QuantumCumulants.jl, aiming to be the first symbolic simplification engine for
Fock algebras.


#### Automatic Floating Point Error Fixer


[Herbie](https://herbie.uwplse.org/) is a tool using equality saturation to automatically rewrites mathematical expressions to enhance
floating-point accuracy. Recently, Herbie's core has been rewritten using
[egg](https://egraphs-good.github.io/), with the tool originally implemented in
a mix of Racket, Scheme, and Rust. While effective, its usage involves multiple
languages, making it impractical for non-experts. The text suggests the theoretical
possibility of porting this technique to a pure Julia solution, seamlessly
integrating with the language, in a single macro `@fp_optimize` that fixes
floating-point errors in expressions just before code compilation and execution.

#### Automatic Theorem Proving in Julia

Metatheory.jl can be used to make a pure Julia Automated Theorem Prover (ATP)
inspired by the use of E-graphs in existing ATP environments like
[Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3), [Simplify](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1066100.1066102) and [CVC4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CVC4), 
in the context of [Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfiability_modulo_theories). 

The two-language problem in program verification can be addressed by allowing users to define high-level
theories about their code, that are statically verified before executing the program. This holds potential for various applications in
software verification, offering a flexible and generic environment for proving
formulae in different logics, and statically verifying such constraints on Julia
code before it gets compiled (see
[Mixtape.jl](https://github.com/JuliaCompilerPlugins/Mixtape.jl)).

To develop such a package, Metatheory.jl needs:

- Introduction of Proof Production in equality saturation.
- SMT in conjunction with a SAT solver like [PicoSAT.jl](https://github.com/sisl/PicoSAT.jl)
- Experiments with various logic theories and software verification applications.

#### Other potential applications

Many projects that could potentially be ported to Julia are listed on the [egg website](https://egraphs-good.github.io/).
A simple search for ["equality saturation" on Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q="equality+saturation") shows many new articles that leverage the techniques used in this packages. 

PLDI is a premier academic forum in the field of programming languages and programming systems research, which organizes an [e-graph symposium](https://pldi23.sigplan.org/home/egraphs-2023) where many interesting research and projects have been presented.

## Theoretical Developments

There's also lots of room for theoretical improvements to the e-graph data structure and equality saturation rewriting.  

#### Associative-Commutative-Distributive e-matching

In classical rewriting SymbolicUtils.jl offers a mechanism for matching expressions with associative and commutative operations: [`@acrule`](https://docs.sciml.ai/SymbolicUtils/stable/manual/rewrite/#Associative-Commutative-Rules) - a special kind of rule that considers all permutations and combinations of arguments. In e-graph rewriting in Metatheory.jl, associativity and commutativity have to be explicitly defined as rules. However, the presence of such rules, together with distributivity, will likely cause equality saturation to loop infinitely. See ["Why reasonable rules can create infinite loops"](https://github.com/egraphs-good/egg/discussions/60) for an explanation.

Some workaround exists for ensuring termination of equality saturation: bounding the depth of search, or merge-only rewriting without introducing new terms (see ["Ensuring the Termination of EqSat over a Terminating Term Rewriting System"](https://effect.systems/blog/ta-completion.html)). 

There's a few theoretical questions left:

- **What kind of rewrite systems terminate in equality saturation**?
- Can associative-commutative matching be applied efficiently to e-graphs while avoiding combinatory explosion?
- Can e-graphs be extended to include nodes with special algebraic properties, in order to mitigate the downsides of non-terminating systems?
