A rule object is callable, and takes an expression and rewrites it if it matches the LHS pattern to the RHS pattern, returns nothing otherwise. The rule language is described below.\n\nLHS can be any possibly nested function call expression where any of the arugments can optionally be a Slot (~x) or a Segment (~x...) (described below).\n\nSLOTS is an optional list of symbols to be interpeted as slots or segments directly (without using ~).  To declare slots for several rules at once, see the @slots macro.\n\nIf an expression matches LHS entirely, then it is rewritten to the pattern in the RHS , whose local scope includes the slot matches as variables. Segment (~x) and slot variables (~~x) on the RHS will substitute the result of the matches found for these variables in the LHS.\n\nRule operators:\n\nLHS => RHS: create a DynamicRule. The RHS is evaluated on rewrite.\nLHS --> RHS: create a RewriteRule. The RHS is not evaluated but symbolically substituted on rewrite.\nLHS == RHS: create a EqualityRule. In e-graph rewriting, this rule behaves like RewriteRule but can go in both directions. Doesn't work in classical rewriting\nLHS ≠ RHS: create a UnequalRule. Can only be used in e-graphs, and is used to eagerly stop the process of rewriting if LHS is found to be equal to RHS.\n\nSlot:\n\nA Slot variable is written as ~x and matches a single expression. x is the name of the variable. If a slot appears more than once in an LHS expression then expression matched at every such location must be equal (as shown by isequal).\n\nExample:\n\nSimple rule to turn any sin into cos:\n\njulia> r = @rule sin(~x) --> cos(~x)\nsin(~x) --> cos(~x)\n\njulia> r(:(sin(1+a)))\n:(cos((1 + a)))\n\nA rule with 2 segment variables\n\njulia> r = @rule sin(~x + ~y) --> sin(~x)*cos(~y) + cos(~x)*sin(~y)\nsin(~x + ~y) --> sin(~x) * cos(~y) + cos(~x) * sin(~y)\n\njulia> r(:(sin(a + b)))\n:(cos(a)*sin(b) + sin(a)*cos(b))\n\nA rule that matches two of the same expressions:\n\njulia> r = @rule sin(~x)^2 + cos(~x)^2 --> 1\nsin(~x) ^ 2 + cos(~x) ^ 2 --> 1\n\njulia> r(:(sin(2a)^2 + cos(2a)^2))\n1\n\njulia> r(:(sin(2a)^2 + cos(a)^2))\n# nothing\n\nA rule without ~\n\njulia> r = @slots x y z @rule x(y + z) --> x*y + x*z\nx(y + z) --> x*y + x*z\n\nSegment: A Segment variable matches zero or more expressions in the function call. Segments may be written by splatting slot variables (~x...).\n\nExample:\n\njulia> r = @rule f(~xs...) --> g(~xs...);\njulia> r(:(f(1, 2, 3)))\n:(g(1,2,3))\n\nPredicates:\n\nThere are two kinds of predicates, namely over slot variables and over the whole rule. For the former, predicates can be used on both ~x and ~~x by using the ~x::f or ~~x::f. Here f can be any julia function. In the case of a slot the function gets a single matched subexpression, in the case of segment, it gets an array of matched expressions.\n\nThe predicate should return true if the current match is acceptable, and false otherwise.\n\njulia> two_πs(x::Number) = abs(round(x/(2π)) - x/(2π)) < 10^-9\ntwo_πs (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> two_πs(x) = false\ntwo_πs (generic function with 2 methods)\n\njulia> r = @rule sin(~~x + ~y::two_πs + ~~z) => :(sin($(Expr(:call, :+, ~~x..., ~~z...))))\nsin(~(~x) + ~(y::two_πs) + ~(~z)) --> sin(+(~(~x)..., ~(~z)...))\n\njulia> r(:(sin(a+$(3π))))\n\njulia> r(:(sin(a+$(6π))))\n:(sin(+a))\n\njulia> r(sin(a+6π+c))\n:(sin(a + c))\n\nPredicate function gets an array of values if attached to a segment variable (~x...).\n\nFor the predicate over the whole rule, use @rule <LHS> => <RHS> where <predicate>:\n\njulia> predicate(x) = x === a;\n\njulia> r = @rule ~x => ~x where f(~x);\n\njulia> r(a)\na\n\njulia> r(b) === nothing\ntrue\n\nNote that this is syntactic sugar and that it is the same as @rule ~x => f(~x) ? ~x : nothing.\n\nCompatibility: Segment variables may still be written as (~~x), and slot (~x) and segment (~x... or ~~x) syntaxes on the RHS will still substitute the result of the matches.

Several projects have very recently repurposed EGraphs to implement state-of-the-art, rewrite-driven compiler optimizations and program synthesizers using a technique known as equality saturation. Metatheory.jl provides a general purpose, customizable implementation of EGraphs and equality saturation, inspired from the egg library for Rust. You can read more about the design of the EGraph data structure and equality saturation algorithm in the egg paper.","category":"page"},{"location":"egraphs/","page":"EGraphs and Equality Saturation","title":"EGraphs and Equality Saturation","text":"See Alessandro Cheli and Philip Zucker's  talk at JuliaCon 2021 for an overview of the concepts introduced in this chapter of the manual (NOTE: Syntax in the talk slideshow is out of date).","category":"page"},{"location":"egraphs/#What-can-I-do-with-EGraphs-in-Metatheory.jl?","page":"EGraphs and Equality Saturation","title":"What can I do with EGraphs in Metatheory.jl?","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"egraphs/","page":"EGraphs and Equality Saturation","title":"EGraphs and Equality Saturation","text":"In classical term rewriting, rewrites are typically destructive and forget the matched left-hand side.

Most importantly, with EGraph rewriting you can use bidirectional rewrite rules, such as equalities without worrying about the ordering and confluence of your rewrite system! Therefore, rule application in EGraphs is non-destructive - everything is copied! This allows users to run non-deterministic rewrite systems.
