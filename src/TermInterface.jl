"""
This module defines a contains definitions for common functions that are useful for symbolic expression manipulation.
Its purpose is to provide a shared interface between various symbolic programming Julia packages.

This is currently borrowed from TermInterface.jl. 
If you want to use Metatheory.jl, please use this internal interface, as we are waiting that 
a redesign proposal of the interface package will reach consensus. When this happens, this module 
will be moved back into a separate package.

See https://github.com/JuliaSymbolics/TermInterface.jl/pull/22

"""
  istree(x)

Returns `true` if `x` is a term. If true, `operation`, `arguments`
must also be defined for `x` appropriately.
"""
istree(x) = false
export istree

"""
  symtype(x)

Returns the symbolic type of `x`. By default this is just `typeof(x)`.
Define this for your symbolic types if you want `SymbolicUtils.simplify` to apply rules
specific to numbers (such as commutativity of multiplication). Or such
rules that may be implemented in the future.
"""

  issym(x)

Returns `true` if `x` is a symbol. If true, `nameof` must be defined
on `x` and must return a Symbol.

"""
  exprhead(x)

If `x` is a term as defined by `istree(x)`, `exprhead(x)` must return a symbol,
corresponding to the head of the `Expr` most similar to the term `x`.
If `x` represents a function call, for example, the `exprhead` is `:call`.
If `x` represents an indexing operation, such as `arr[i]`, then `exprhead` is `:ref`.
Note that `exprhead` is different from `operation` and both functions should 
be defined correctly in order to let other packages provide code generation 
and pattern matching features. 
"""

"""
  head(x)

If `x` is a term as defined by `istree(x)`, `head(x)` returns the head of the
term if `x`. The `head` type has to be provided by the package.
"""
function head end

"""
  head_symbol(x::HeadType)

If `x` is a head object, `head_symbol(T, x)` returns a `Symbol` object that
corresponds to `y.head` if `y` was the representation of the corresponding term
as a Julia Expression. This is useful to define interoperability between
symbolic term types defined in different packages and should be used when
calling `maketerm`.

Get the arguments of `x`, must be defined if `istree(x)` is `true`.

  operation(x)

If `x` is a term as defined by `istree(x)`, `operation(x)` returns the
operation of the term if `x` represents a function call, for example, the head
is the function being called.

"""
  arguments(x)

Get the arguments of `x`, must be defined if `istree(x)` is `true`.

"""
  unsorted_arguments(x::T)

If x is a term satisfying `istree(x)` and your term type `T` orovides
and optimized implementation for storing the arguments, this function can 
be used to retrieve the arguments when the order of arguments does not matter 
but the speed of the operation does.

Returns the number of arguments of `x`. Implicitly defined 
if `arguments(x)` is defined.

"""
  metadata(x)

Return the metadata attached to `x`.
"""

  metadata(x, md)

Returns a new term which has the structure of `x` but also has
the metadata `md` attached to it.
"""

"""
  maketerm(head::H, children; type=Any, metadata=nothing)

Has to be implemented by the provider of H.
Returns a term that is in the same closure of types as `typeof(x)`,
with `head` as the head and `children` as the arguments, `type` as the symtype
and `metadata` as the metadata. 
"""

Returns a single argument anonymous function predicate, that returns `true` if and only if
the argument to the predicate satisfies `istree` and `operation(x) == f`

Take a struct definition and automatically define `TermInterface` methods. This
will automatically define a head type. If `HeadType` is given then it will be
used as `head(::Foo)`. If it is omitted, and the struct is called `Foo`, then
the head type will be called `FooHead`. The `head_symbol` of such head types
will default to `:call`.
