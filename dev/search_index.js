We define the type of WHILE's memory as a map from variables (Julia Symbols) to actual values. We want to keep things simple so in our toy programming language we are just going to use boolean or integer values. Surprisingly, we can still achieve turing completeness without having to introduce strings or any other complex data type. We are going to use the letter σ (sigma) to denote an actual value of type Mem, in simple words the state of a program in a given moment.

A rule object is callable, and takes an expression and rewrites it if it matches the LHS pattern to the RHS pattern, returns nothing otherwise. The rule language is described below.\n\nLHS can be any possibly nested function call expression where any of the arugments can optionally be a Slot (~x) or a Segment (~x...) (described below).\n\nSLOTS is an optional list of symbols to be interpeted as slots or segments directly (without using ~).  To declare slots for several rules at once, see the @slots macro.\n\nIf an expression matches LHS entirely, then it is rewritten to the pattern in the RHS , whose local scope includes the slot matches as variables. Segment (~x) and slot variables (~~x) on the RHS will substitute the result of the matches found for these variables in the LHS.\n\nRule operators:\n\nLHS => RHS: create a DynamicRule. The RHS is evaluated on rewrite.\nLHS --> RHS: create a RewriteRule. The RHS is not evaluated but symbolically substituted on rewrite.\nLHS == RHS: create a EqualityRule. In e-graph rewriting, this rule behaves like RewriteRule but can go in both directions. Doesn't work in classical rewriting\nLHS ≠ RHS: create a UnequalRule. Can only be used in e-graphs, and is used to eagerly stop the process of rewriting if LHS is found to be equal to RHS.\n\nSlot:\n\nA Slot variable is written as ~x and matches a single expression. x is the name of the variable.

For the former, predicates can be used on both ~x and ~~x by using the ~x::f or ~~x::f. Here f can be any julia function. In the case of a slot the function gets a single matched subexpression, in the case of segment, it gets an array of matched expressions.\n\nThe predicate should return true if the current match is acceptable, and false otherwise.\n\njulia> two_πs(x::Number) = abs(round(x/(2π)) - x/(2π)) < 10^-9\ntwo_πs (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> two_πs(x) = false\ntwo_πs (generic function with 2 methods)\n\njulia> r = @rule sin(~~x + ~y::two_πs + ~~z) => :(sin($(Expr(:call, :+, ~~x..., ~~z...))))\nsin(~(~x) + ~(y::two_πs) + ~(~z)) --> sin(+(~(~x)..., ~(~z)...))\n\njulia> r(:(sin(a+$(3π))))\n\njulia> r(:(sin(a+$(6π))))\n:(sin(+a))\n\njulia> r(sin(a+6π+c))\n:(sin(a + c))\n\nPredicate function gets an array of values if attached to a segment variable (~x...).\n\nFor the predicate over the whole rule, use @rule <LHS> => <RHS> where <predicate>:\n\njulia> predicate(x) = x === a;\n\njulia> r = @rule ~x => ~x where f(~x);\n\njulia> r(a)\na\n\njulia> r(b) === nothing\ntrue\n\nNote that this is syntactic sugar and that it is the same as @rule ~x => f(~x) ? ~x : nothing.\n\nCompatibility: Segment variables may still be written as (~~x), and slot (~x) and segment (~x... or ~~x) syntaxes on the RHS will still substitute the result of the matches.
