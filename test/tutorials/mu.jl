# # The MU Puzzle 
# The puzzle cannot be solved: it is impossible to change the string MI into MU
# by repeatedly applying the given rules. In other words, MU is not a theorem of
# the MIU formal system. To prove this, one must step "outside" the formal system
# itself. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MU_puzzle#Solution)

# Here are the axioms of MU:
# * Composition of the string monoid is associative
# * Add a uf to the end of any string ending in I
# * Double the string after the M
# * Replace any III with a U
# * Remove any UU
